## Concepts

- This firebase project is based on SDK method
- Since the browser doesn't support `module`, a bundler `webpack` is implemented in this project to bundle all the `.js` file
- `.env` file is used to store senstivie information for security reason, which makes google more likely not to mark your website dangerous
- Contact google via Google Cloud Console if the website is still considered dangerous by google. It usually takes 2 days to remove the dangerous mark.
